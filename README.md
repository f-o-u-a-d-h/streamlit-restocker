# üè• Hospital Medicine Restocking Predictor

## üìò Introduction
This project is a machine learning-powered web application designed to help hospitals optimize their medicine restocking process. It allows hospital staff to input current usage statistics and inventory levels and receive a recommendation on how much medicine to restock. This is particularly useful in minimizing waste, preventing shortages, and managing hospital logistics efficiently.

The underlying model was trained on **synthetic hospital inventory data** that was generated to simulate realistic demand patterns for a high-demand generic drug. The simulated dataset was crafted to reflect variations in hospital department visits, consumption trends, and inventory dynamics across time.

Given the tabular nature of the data and the presence of both numerical and categorical features, **LightGBM** was selected for modeling due to its:
- Strong performance on structured datasets
- Built-in handling of categorical variables
- Speed and efficiency, especially with large feature sets and high-dimensional data

The model was trained offline and saved as `restocking_model.pkl`. It is loaded during inference and does not require retraining in the deployed application.

The app is deployed using Streamlit Cloud for easy access, interaction, and demonstration.

## üöÄ Usage

### Web App Interface
After launching, you will see a form to enter:
- Date
- Number of outpatient visits (max 2,500)
- Number of emergency visits (max 250)
- Number of inpatient admissions (max 250)
- Quantity of medicine consumed (max 3,000 tablets)
- Quantity of medicine currently in stock (max 5,000 tablets)

Click the **Predict** button and the app will display the ideal quantity of medicine to restock.

### Docker Usage (optional)
You can also run this app in a Docker container.

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t streamlit-restocker .
```
2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit-restocker
```
3. Access the app at:
```
http://localhost:8501
```
